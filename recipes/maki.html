        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I can't claim this to be authentic, but it sure was tasty and packed just enough heat for my preference.</p>
        <p>If you are concerned with raw fish, try using cold smoked salmon.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
            <li>1½ cups water</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package nori (dry seaweed)</li>
            <li>1 medium avocado, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) farmed Atlantic salmon</li>
            <li>3 stalks green onions, halved lengthwise</li>
            <li>¼ cup sriracha mayonnaise (Kikkoman)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons black sesame seeds</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon wasabi paste, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pickled ginger, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Rinse rice in a strainer under cold running water until water runs clear. Combine rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine rice wine vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Remove and allow to cool. Stir vinegar mixture into the cooked rice - rice will dry as it cools. Allow rice to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of nori onto a sushi mat. Place about 1/2 cup rice on top and, using a rice paddle, spread rice onto the nori sheet.</li>
            <li>Flip nori over so rice is facing down. Arrange 3 to 4 avocado slices, about 2 ounces salmon, 1 strip green onion, and 2 teaspoons Sriracha mayonnaise down the middle of the nori sheet.</li>
            <li>Carefully, but tightly, roll nori up by closing in on the ingredients to form a roll. Drizzle each roll with hoisin sauce and more Sriracha mayonnaise and sprinkle with both types of sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Slice each sushi roll into 8 pieces. Serve with a dollop of wasabi and pickled ginger on the side.</li>
        </ol>
